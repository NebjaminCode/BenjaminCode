                <div class="about--content">
                    <p>
                        After graduating with a bachelor's degree in Communications from DePaul University in 2017, I moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of breaking into the entertainment & media industry. After successfully landing a role in a leadership development program run by NBCUniversal, I did just that; I found myself in a position to learn from, and work alongside, some of the industry's most powerful players. From creative development to operations, I was exposed to the plethora of pieces that make a powerhouse like NBCU tick.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After my year in the program was up, I was presented with yet another once in a lifetime opportunity - to help launch a startup funded by two of LA's most prominent businesses. NBCUniversal had recently announced a $500MM investment in Snap, inc., and as a part of the investment, the two would be coming together to form a third party, joint venture startup. I was interally recruited from NCBU to join the launch team. I was initially hired as a general Coordinator to help manage everything from day-to-day operations to strategic planning to creative development, but was quickly promoted to Project Coordinator. In the new role, I was in charge of managing the company's media input/output and technical operations, as well as specific long term projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In late 2019, NBC began to shift the company into a decidedly tech-centric business strategy. As a part of this new strategy, NBC would be launching its own streaming service and it was at this point that my entire team was absorbed into NBC's Digital Enterprises division to help bring our knowledge of the tech landscape to the new project. As the project grew and transformed into Peacock, Covid-19 began to reveal itself as the pandemic that the world is currently grappeling with. As the effects of the pandemic began to take hold of the economy, my team, alongside a slew of other employees, were let go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Towards the end of my year as a Page, I began to realize the importance of being technologically literate and started on my journey to learn to program. I realized that my fascination with the job offer I had with the JV was not only because of the entertainment and content aspect of things, but because of the innovative approach that I'd have the opportunity to develop when it came to delivering that very content. Essentially, it became clear that broadcast television and traditional media were quickly becoming a thing of the past, and I wanted to be at the forefront of that change. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since my time at NBCU and Snap has come to a close, I've been focusing on developing many of the side projects that I've started over the past year or so. Please find my current projects below. In tandem with the projects themselves, I've developed a working knowledge and understanding HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and am currently working on familiarizing myself with Node.js and PHP. Between my projects, freelance work, and self education, I've found a great balance for keeping busy during the ongoing pandemic.

                    NBCUniversal's Page Program is a far cry from what you may have seen on the network's own show, <i>30 Rock</i>. As a year long leadership development program for early career professionals in the media & entertainment industry, the Page Program selects only 1.5% of it's 16,000 annual applicants. During the year long program, Pages take on 3-4 distinct positions throughout the conglomerate's portfolio of companies to learn the industry inside and out.

                    In late 2017, NBCUniversal and Snap broke the news that they would be forming a joint venture company. Indigo, as it came to be known, was created with the intention of taking NBCUniversal's expertise in entertainment and media and apply it to the burgoening tech landscape that Snap was at the forefront of. When the JV launched the following year, I was recruited out of the Page Program as part of the initial team.

                     As the media and tech landscapes began to change, NBCUniversal adopted a decidedly tech-centric approach to entertainment. Indigo, the JV between NBCU & Snap, was dissolved and my team was absorbed into NBC's Digital Enterprises division on the Direct-To-Consumer streaming team.
